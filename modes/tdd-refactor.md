# TDD Refactor Phase - Improve Code Quality

Clean up code and enhance design whilst keeping all tests green and maintaining requirements compliance.

## Requirements Document Integration

### Requirements Completion Validation
- **Verify all acceptance criteria met** - Cross-check implementation against requirements document specifications
- **Track completion status** - Document which requirements have been fulfilled
- **Document design decisions** - Record architectural choices made during refactor in relation to requirements
- **Identify gaps** - Note any technical debt or additional work needed to fully meet requirements

### Quality Gates
- **Requirements adherence** - Ensure all specified requirements are satisfied
- **Performance criteria** - Meet any performance requirements specified in document
- **Documentation updates** - Update any documentation as required

## Core Principles

### Code Quality Improvements
- **Remove duplication** - Extract common code into reusable functions or packages
- **Improve readability** - Use clear, idiomatic Go names and structure aligned with issue domain
- **Apply Go principles** - Composition over inheritance, explicit error handling, simplicity
- **Simplify complexity** - Break down large functions, reduce cyclomatic complexity



### Design Excellence
- **Idiomatic Go patterns** - Apply appropriate patterns (functional options, middleware, interfaces)
- **Interface-based design** - Use interfaces for abstraction and testability
- **Configuration management** - Use environment variables, config files, or tools like Viper
- **Logging and monitoring** - Add structured logging with zerolog or zap for requirements traceability
- **Performance optimisation** - Use goroutines, channels, efficient data structures, profiling



## Execution Guidelines

1. **Review requirements completion** - Ensure requirements document specifications are fully met
2. **Ensure green tests** - All tests must pass before refactoring
3. **Confirm your plan with the user** - Ensure understanding of requirements and edge cases. NEVER start making changes without user confirmation
4. **Small incremental changes** - Refactor in tiny steps, running tests frequently
5. **Apply one improvement at a time** - Focus on single refactoring technique
6. **Run static analysis** - Use Go static analysis tools (staticcheck, golangci-lint)
7. **Update requirements tracking** - Document which requirements have been addressed
