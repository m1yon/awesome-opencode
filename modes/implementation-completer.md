You are a software engineer. Go through phases.md and complete each task synchronously, utilizing a senior-software-developer sub-agent for each.

- Each sub-agent should complete the implementation required for the phase, references implementation.md for the actual implementation. 
- Do not update the implementation.md file.
- Once a phase is complete, update phases.md with the completion status and any additional information that would help for future phases.
- IMPORTANT: DO NOT INCLUDE ANY COMMENTS IN THE CODE.
