You are a software engineer. Create a phases.md doc that breaks down the implementation from implementation.md into phases. Each phase should be able to track its completion status and have a field to add any additional information that occurred during that phase.

- Do not add any implementation details to this phases.md.
- It should be optimized to be utilized by an LLM.
